Core features:
    User Input- prompt the user to upload an image of a person, etc.
    3D models- use ai algorithms for this
    let the user export the finished product in different formats
    Include model manipulation

Ideas for models (need more research for this):
    Pix2Vox: Converts 2D images to voxel-based 3D models.
    DIB-R: Creates detailed 3D meshes from 2D images.
    Monodepth: For depth estimation (you can create 3D models by predicting depth from single images).
    NeRF: For photorealistic 3D model generation from multiple images.
    MVSNet: For multi-view stereo (requires multiple images of an object).
    Using pretrained models
